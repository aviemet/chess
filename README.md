Chess in Javascript

Just for fun - Testing movement restrictions and jQuery-UI mouse interaction for a chess game.

Perhaps someday I will attempt to write an AI, but I've never been the biggest chess nerd. Though in reading about how to represent the state of a chess game programatically, the solutions seem interesting aside from the specific application to the game. We'll see.

Currently the game can support two human players at the same location, pieces can move and attack correctly.
Move hinting is supported

Undo support is not fully implemented
En Passant and castling is not implemented
